title: "What is Killing Western Civilization"

Conservatives are rather good at shadow-boxing. They pummel enemies, real and perceived, in private chambers never pierced by the light of the sun. They scorn action, preferring to wage the war of ideas in seclusion. But they are not very good at this, being unable to decide even basic questions of philosophy and history.

The conservative interpretation of the Enlightenment is confused and riddled with pompous quips and muddy thinking. Those who think the Enlightenment represented the height of Western Civilization are pitted against those inclined to think it was the beginning of the end. The tide rages back and forth, and no one seems able to decide anything. This, of course, may be imputed to the intransigence of whoever is wrong.

The question is really less difficult than some people make it out to be. First of all we must establish some basic facts. Western Civilization is dying. The death-blow has been struck. The physical infrastructure remains. It has often been said that we are “running on the fumes of Western Civilization.” This is true. The spiritual depths of the West are drying up rapidly. The patient may yet recover, but for the present, we must diagnose the disease. There are some who would have it civilization is mere bricks and politics, but undoubtedly civilization thrives on deep wells of spiritual energy.

Christianity is the spirit of Western Civilization. If Christianity dies, Western Civilization dies. Most conservatives (if they have just claim to that title) agree with this. Christianity is dying, and has been dying for a long time, as is apparent.

Conservatives may quibble over the details (the character of the Reformation, the American Founding, the exact nature of what has fuzzily been called “liberalism” throughout history), but the question of what killed Western Civilization ultimately boils down to this other question—Are Christianity and liberalism reconcilable?

Again, conservatives can quibble over the details. Certainly liberalism has been infused with strains of Freudianism and modern psychology, influenced by H.G. Wells and Sinclair Lewis, perhaps corrupted almost out of recognition by postmodernism. They may argue over to what extent liberalism is susceptible to what philosophies specifically, and which philosophies most caused its decay. They can argue over specific _political_ decisions that caused decline in specific countries, as well as the nature of the interface between culture and politics.

But if liberalism is irreconcilable with Christianity, liberalism killed Christianity, because liberalism replaced Christianity, and thus liberalism killed Western Civilization. It is no less simple. Liberalism is irreconcilable with Christianity, considering that, as an ideology with its roots in the Enlightenment, it is skeptical, or relativistic. It replaces the worship of God with the worship of tolerance—and sundry other gods, I suppose, which may be inherent to it, or the worship of which it may facilitate, tolerance being an empty god, and liberalism a void. Theological liberalism shares more in common with political liberalism than its name, but again, that is a matter of secondary importance. The main point is: liberalism struck what appears to be a death-blow against Christianity (though Christians must believe it will recover from its mere temporary sickness), and as Christianity is dying, Western Civilization is dying. Thus one may not absolve the Enlightenment of all blame, or tout liberalism as somehow the crowning achievement and high point of Christianity. And one certainly must not take a nuanced view, lest one be rendered dreadfully annoying and wrong to boot.

The roots of decline go deeper than and spread out from liberalism and the period known as the Enlightenment, but sometimes it is useful to be clear in terms of black and white about a problem. The pinnacle of Western Civilization is the disease—like a fever at high pitch.
