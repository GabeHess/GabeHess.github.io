It seems to me that some of the most characteristic arguments in contemporary atheism do not reject God on the grounds that His religion is evil, but are, indeed, precisely an argument for evil.

This strikes the attention most forcibly in Christopher Hitchens’ piece of rhetoric, “Celestial Dictatorship.”

Christopher Hitchens compared God’s reign over Heaven and Earth with totalitarianism. I have no desire to speak ill of the dead—although according to his philosophy, Hitchens is now drifting dust—and so isolate his piece of rhetoric from his personality, as being merely the best expression of an attitude.

We mustn’t leave it at this, but the simplest definition of God is: God is the Good. He is Absolute Good, not merely good, nor absolutely good, but the Absolute Good itself—(or I should say: Himself). Again, descriptions and definitions may proliferate to the end of time, and God remains mysterious, but we can be certain that, God being One, the definition, “God is the Good,” is in its way complete.

Using Hitchens again for example, he wrote a book called, “God is not Great.” This is on the face of it a contradiction. God is by definition Good, and doubtless “Great” too. Some believe rhetoric such as “God is Good” is only that: rhetoric. Others believe God as conceived by Christianity is self-contradictory—too confused a concept to know what to do with. Some believe euphemisms, abstractions, obfuscations, lies, wishful thinking obscure the true nature of Christianity and God—who, given this nature, is now a mass of contradictions, and therefore nonexistent.

Hitchens, I suppose, believed there is a clear contradiction between the confession of God’s so-called “Goodness” and the substance of His “Goodness” as manifested in the Bible and the world. However, the “character” of God in the theologians is clearly that of the Good. The Bible declares Him infinitely just and merciful and Good. Perhaps the God of theology differs from the God of popular religion. But the God of popular religion is understood as Good, and plainly inspires good in the world. Men have differed as to what the Good is. But no one has ever convincingly argued that the God of Christianity is evil, if once He can be proven to exist. Indeed, denial of God leads to denial of Good and Evil. Good cannot be understood in separation from God; so we must grapple with any apparent instances of evil on His part, without taking such apparent evil to represent God’s “true character.” Clearly it is the Christian God of whom we speak, who is better than the God of other religions insofar as He is more perfectly understood.

Any apparent instance of evil by God in history (e.g. Abraham and Isaac) may be understood partly when we realize that God is Good. If God is Good, His direct command to Abraham to sacrifice his son could not be evil, especially in light of subsequent events. It would be a different matter to sacrifice one’s son without God’s express command. These issues become confused by the habit of assuming God’s nonexistence or nonactivity in the world in order to prove Him evil.

There is simply no case for the claim that the Christian God—loving, just, merciful—is anything but Good. At least, it would be one of the more remarkable conspiracy theories.

Hitchens compared God’s “Celestial Dictatorship” to North Korea. North Korea, obviously, has an evil regime, this being the difference. It is an attempt by man to usurp the authority of God, and, as such, according to Christian theology, bound to fail. But that is another matter.

The decisive question is this of Good vs. Evil. North Korea is an evil dictatorship. God’s “Celestial Dictatorship” is quite literally a dictatorship of the Good. It is this to which some atheists object—in favor of a personal commixture of Good and Evil. They reject the reign of Absolute Good over Heaven and Earth, in favor of “individuality,” “personality,” which can only mean an impure mixture of Good and Evil. They enforce liberal (dare I say Whiggish?) legalism on the government of Heaven.

Pascal wrote, “There are only two classes of persons who can be called reasonable: those who serve God with all their heart because they know him and those who seek him with all their heart because they do not know him.” Contemporary atheists do not, often, seek God with all their heart, but seem to prefer that He not exist. They harden themselves to the possibility of Good, and are thus a world apart from those whose atheism is merely the first leg of a long journey of the spirit.
