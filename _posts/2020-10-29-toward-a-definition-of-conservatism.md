Throughout the history of conservatism in America, there has been the eternal problem of definition. How are we to define the outer limits of conservatism? Any attempt to do so has generally been met with indignant cries coming from those beyond the pale. “What presumption! Why have you the right, sir, to say who is and who is not a conservative?”

Much of the griping comes from people who are not conservatives, which explains the difficulty. Of the three pillars of conservatism in the Cold War period—traditionalism, libertarianism, and anti-Communism—two were conservative. Libertarians and classical liberals, albeit with a few conservative convictions, certainly are not.

Russell Kirk, a traditionalist, has done more to define the limits of conservatism than anyone. But he agreed with many that conservatism is not an ideology (an assertion that can have different meanings), and has ample room for differences of opinion, even of fundamental perspective. For conservatism does not depend on abstract reason. Indeed, we have here a sure test.

In order to qualify as a conservative, a person must have some instrument for viewing the world more complex and traditional than mere abstract reason. This is not to disparage reason, but for it to be conservative, it must be founded on something more substantial than a utilitarian calculus of pleasure and pain, a liberal calculus of freedom, or obvious basic fact.

There is a habit of talking as if reason and tradition, reason and faith, reason and what have you are opposed. Of course they are really only opposed if tradition, faith, or what have you are wrong. Thus utilitarian liberalism is seen as the epitome of reason, and anything else may be well enough, but is less rational than it might be. I am reminded of G.K. Chesterton pointing out that words such as “freethinking” are given, not to a process, but to an outcome. You are a freethinker if you reach certain conclusions. So you are eminently rational if you reach certain conclusions. The mark of these conclusions is that they are simple and obvious, where existence is complex, as are the conclusions of the traditional and faithful.

We mustn’t let certain forms of utilitarian liberalism creep into conservative thought. Thus there is a form of it minimally predicated on the so-called “dignity of man”—which here means next to nothing. This allows one to be pro-life without committing to anything too serious or controversial.

Conservative thought must also not depend on mere unambiguous fact. Short-term political battles may be won with “facts and logic,” but long-term cultural battles never will be. Nor need we attenuate our own worldview so far as to render it a machine in which data are parsed. But for our purposes, the conclusive argument against mere “facts and logic” is that they are not themselves fundamentally conservative.

The conservative must look through the lens of some more complex mechanism, or better, worldview. We might call it an immediate mechanistic part of a worldview based on reason. And it must agree with other conservative mechanisms in this respect—it must be traditional.

For instance, Christianity, history, and human nature all provide lenses through which a conservative may view the world.

The first lens is Christianity, not religion, for several reasons. Because in the West, Christianity is the traditional religion. Because conservatism in the twenty-first century must be not only viable, but also compelling, and Christianity is by far the most compelling religion to an unbiased mind. And because Christianity possesses the moderation of truth. Of course devout Christianity has always had an an element of radicalism to it. Indeed, Christianity is quite radical. It is opposed to the ways of the world—though this opposition will always be mostly in the personal sphere.

Religion cannot be boxed off into separation from the rest of one’s personality. There mustn’t be “religious Ben” alongside (by implication) “rational Ben”, or even “reasonable,” “normal,” “sane,” or “nonthreatening Ben.” There must simply be Ben—and Ben must be religious. And where every Ben is religious, it will be reflected, and ought to be reflected, in the laws and mores of society.

Judaism may be conservative too, but one doubts if it is vital enough to defy the onslaught of secularism.

Conservatives may analyze the world by means of human nature. By human nature, I mean a personal understanding of human nature, gained through observation (personal and vicarious, through reading, &c.), introspection, historical studies, and perhaps psychology. But knowledge of human nature acquired through the scientific (i.e. “dissecting”) study of psychology will not do. It is imperfect and incomplete. Psychology after the fashion of Viktor Frankl is fodder for conservatism. But books such as _The Righteous Mind_ are flawed in their premises and method, and bring us little actual insight, and what insight they bring is often wrong. Analyses of laboratory man inevitably assume man is reducible to numbers, and in reducing him to numbers, err. But a macro-analysis shows man, _in fact_, is not so reducible. He is possessed of reason and free will. Where a macro-analysis points to one conclusion, and the numbers gleaned from a laboratory point to another, it is the rational thing to trust the first. Especially since the numbers gleaned from a laboratory are subject to interpretation, and are often taken as proving more than they do in fact prove. For instance, simply because man’s visual system is sometimes played upon by optical illusions, it is not valid to conclude that everything man sees is an illusion. Thus to analyze man by means of his nature (an antidote to radicalism) is fundamentally conservative.

To analyze human affairs through the lens of history is also conservative. Of course history gives key insights into human nature. But the patterns of history are useful too. In general, anything that connects us to concrete realities is conservative. A sober analysis of economic history may even be. But one should beware of anything too simplistic.

There are other conservative lenses. Myth is one. Victor Davis Hanson’s analysis of Trump as a possible “tragic hero” is conservative, as is his general analysis of Trump in the light of history.

Thus there is room for varying methods, but not for utilitarianism, liberalism, or mere unequivocal fact. Nor is there room for modern methods of analysis founded on, for instance, modern psychology or identity. For conservatism has always been at war with modernity.
