Secular utopianism is undoubtedly motivated by the desire to play God. Intuition has always told us this, which is made stronger when the nature of a certain kind of reason (reason as an instrument of power over being) is considered.

According to Christians, God created the universe out of nothingness in an impulse of pure love. The atheist and secular utopian would create a world out of the fabric of his own personal reason—spin it out of his own head, while asserting its universality, the source of which is the self-containedness of its author.

He believes that reason is universal—but reason is only universal if you are God.

He can conceive of a godless world, and a good one at that, so he thinks it is possible. He can apprehend what everyone would have to do to make it possible. But he is not everyone. He is an individual, playing God. Truly reason is a personal affair. Every individual, in his godless world, would not have as motive the overmastering vision in his head, the vision of a supremely rational and ordered universe, but rather, a calculation of personal interest. Reason only unites when enforced by absolute truth or by power. Reason unites in the head of God; in the many individual heads of men it divides—making action multiple.

The secular utopian is convinced he can make everyone see reason—nay more, act on reason—but it is only reason when everyone does so, only when there is some all-powerful body to enforce it. So his utopianism fails every time.

It is not only that he has a desire to play God, he _is_ playing God. He is creating a Paradise out of his own head, a Garden of Eden. But he is not going to make the same mistake the Old God made. He is not going to let Evil into _his_ Garden. But this means he is a God who does not allow people freedom.

In his Paradise, everyone is “reasonable,” seeing the benefit to all of universal reason. This “reason” requires everyone to act reasonably. But this cannot be expected. It is more likely that everyone will act unreasonably, leaving the individual no choice but to do likewise, and without even a conscience grounded in Eternity, giving freedom from earthly pressure and want.

One is reminded of those frightfully naive men (the same, in fact), who thought we could unilaterally disarm in the face of the Soviet menace. They may have thought, if we are reasonable, they will be too. They may not have realized that earthly reason requires the consent of all parties.

In totalitarian society, one cannot point to wrong done by any one individual according to the law of self-interest, even of enlightened self-interest. One can point to wrong done according to the eternal, universal law of Heaven, but that is another matter. The moment a reasonable society becomes unreasonable, everyone is compelled to act unreasonably—by the very law of “rational” “self-interest” the secular utopians promote. They are blinded from seeing this by that strange insistence on “our” capacity to be reasonable, meaning _their_ theoretical capacity to act for everyone else.

An irritating feeling that he could simply dash the reigns of the world to the ground, and take them up himself, and steer the world, vexes our secular utopian. He can see it all so beautifully in his head—the many millions all moving and thinking according to his orderly plan, or debating and engaging in processes calculated to cause a neat, orderly procession into a predetermined future; reasonable, reasonable governance; reasonable, reasonable rows upon rows of neighbors—that he almost imagines this vision is reality—this cosmopolis in his head is under the central direction of his master-mind. He can see it, feel it, it is all there—so he thinks the world really will act on his reason, everyone doing as he sees them doing.

I know this, because I have caught myself—in moments of doubt—constructing such worlds in my own head—worlds under my central direction. Secular utopianism would work, if everyone would do as I see them doing in my head. But it is _my_ head, not theirs, and if I do not take account of the impressive stupidity of the world, nor the goodness of freedom, nor the personal nature of reason, nor (for Pete’s sake) my own capacity for sin, it is from a habit of playing God. Habit is borne of desire.
