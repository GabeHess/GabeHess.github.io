title: "A Defense of Poetry: Case Study: Dissent From Modernity [Ⅳ]"
description: "If meter is essential to poetry, the answer is in the question..."

Here is a poem by William Wordsworth:

The world is too much with us; late and soon,  
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—  
Little we see in Nature that is ours;  
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!  
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;  
The winds that will be howling at all hours,  
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;  
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;  
It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be  
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;  
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,  
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;  
Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;  
Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.  

This is not the best of Wordsworth’s poems. Nor does it offer an especially useful solution to a world of getting and spending. But it is a clear dissent from modernity, and makes it plain that Wordsworth would prefer even pagan wonder to modern cynicism. He dissents in the name of nature, and his is probably not the most commendable attitude anyway. But at least the poem has some modicum of sincerity to it; at least it clearly dissents.

Let us take instead Chesterton’s poem, “Modern Elfland”:

I cut a staff in a churchyard copse,  
I clad myself in ragged things,  
I set a feather in my cap  
That fell out of an angel’s wings.  

I filled my wallet with white stones,  
I took three foxgloves in my hand,  
I slung my shoes across my back,  
And so I went to fairyland.  

But lo, within that ancient place  
Science had reared her iron crown,  
And the great cloud of steam went up  
That telleth where she takes a town.  

But cowled with smoke and starred with lamps,  
That strange land’s light was still its own;  
The word that witched the woods and hills  
Spoke in the iron and the stone.  

Not Nature’s hand had ever curved  
That mute unearthly porter’s spine.  
Like sleeping dragon’s sudden eyes  
The signals leered along the line.  

The chimneys thronging crooked or straight  
Were fingers signalling the sky;  
The dog that strayed across the street  
Seemed four-legged by monstrosity.  

‘In vain,’ I cried, ‘though you too touch  
The new time’s desecrating hand,  
Through all the noises of a town  
I hear the heart of fairyland.’  

I read the name above a door,  
Then through my spirit pealed and passed:  
‘This is the town of thine own home,  
And thou hast looked on it at last.’  

Here we have not so much a dissent from modernity as an affirmation of the timeless, which even science, with her iron crown, cannot build over. If I were a literary critic, I might even say, “Chesterton finds wonder in a cynic’s world. He finds the idiosyncratic and the fairy-tale-esque even where things have been painted over with the brush of industrialization.” Or I would I say, “Chesterton defies the forces of machine and factory to draw the magic out of ‘fairyland.’ To his surprise, at the end of the poem, he discovers he has found his home. Thus Chesterton projects his own neuroses: the ‘fairyland’ that he loved in his childhood is now realized for him in a grown man’s world. ‘Modern Elfland’ is a fusion of his struggle with the harsh realities of the world, repression and guilt following his conversion to Roman Catholicism, and a recent bout of indigestion.” Probably I would dissect his psychology, as well as the themes, tropes, and gimmicks used in the poem, and the long incubation in fragments of poetry culminating in it. (More likely, I would not waste my time linking the poetry of “second-rate” poets to various points in the cultural past, analyzing predecessors, and so forth, when there is a whole world of poetry transcendentally ugly, but read, discussed, wondered at, and abstractly defended or debunked by poets and critics, to mull over.) But I am not a literary critic.

Or let us take Gerard Manley Hopkins’ poem, “God’s Grandeur”:

The world is charged with the grandeur of God.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil  
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?  
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil  
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.  

And for all this, nature is never spent;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;  
And though the last lights off the black West went  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs —  
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent  
&nbsp; &nbsp; World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.  

This is the best poem of the three. And if the reader will permit the bland comments which I addressed to the first two to be accompanied by more bland comments on this, I shall say that it, again, finds in modernity something seemingly antithetical to the modern spirit, which is able to survive by being timeless. “Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;” and yet that which is timeless remains. “All is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;” and yet the blears and the smears do nothing to alter the fact: that “the world is charged with the grandeur of God.”

I do not know, never having taught anything of this sort to anyone in my life, but perhaps the modern student will have greater difficulty with this poem than with more relevant stuff. But that is no reason to dismiss it, since one does not triumph over modernity by catering to modernity. The question, of course, is one of prior education, not of some incapacity on the part of modern students to understand anything not spelled out in ABCs. The poem, I am aware, is very popular among young Catholic students.

These three poems comment in a way on the problem of modernity. We live in a cynical, ugly, desanctified world. All three poems are optimistic, the first especially when read in light of Wordsworth’s other poetry. But in the first is the optimism that comes of withdrawing from the world, and taking solace in dreams of and laments for another. An infinite number of other poems might be adduced, which do not explicitly address the problem of modernity, but which offer solutions to it nonetheless. “Daffodils” by Wordsworth is a better poem than the one above, and offers a more positive solution. It is, again, the solution of illusion, which no honest or manly person would want to take.

If there is a dearth of modern poems, of the caliber of “God’s Grandeur,” offering viable alternatives to modernity, it is mostly because there is a dearth of modern poetry that is good. But one need not even read modern poetry to find one’s compass in the modern world. Shakespeare was more familiar with the modern problem than we are. Great poetry, like ethics, never dies. And if it never dies, it can only be for one reason: that it is timeless. And if it is timeless, it can tell us everything that is important about our own age, while only neglecting the ephemeral. This is not to say that we should not continue to write poetry—or rather, it is not to say that we collectively, as a species, should not continue to write poetry; clearly many of us as individuals should not write poetry as fast we can, with maximum efficiency; but the reader understands my point. But there is no reason under the sun why modern poetry need fully imbibe the spirit of the age.

Since I am writing a book about Eliot, the reader will expect me to juxtapose a few lines of his to the poems I have quoted above. There are two reasons I cannot do so. First, because Eliot’s poetry, by its very nature cannot be analyzed in bits, but must be taken as a whole. Secondly, because I hope the reader will read Eliot’s major poems (_The Waste Land_, “Prufrock,” etc.) along with this book, judging for himself whether what I say is just. Certainly if the reader is barely or only adequately acquainted with Eliot’s poetry, I would weep to discover that he was relying on such fragments as I provided herein to judge of it.

Besides, it is not necessarily true that I am writing a book about Eliot. Mostly I am writing a book about “_not_ Eliot.” It will become increasingly apparent that, regardless of Eliot’s status as a poet, his is not the solution that we can carry into the future. We must find another way.
