It is said by the chauvinists of science, that religion is antagonistic to the spirit of free intellectual inquiry. Reasonable people then point out that it is not so, but in this essay, I propose that the tables might be turned. Religion is not only not antagonistic to the spirit of free intellectual inquiry, it may, in times such as ours, be highly conducive to it.

Certainly religion is a source of courage to the beleaguered individual. The utilitarian has no reason to resist the state, society, or anything significantly powerful. The utilitarian should not mind lying to appease the system. But the Christian believes that what he says, even what he thinks, matters. In the end, then, the Christian will have the courage to resist the powers of evil, where the secularist will not.

But where society is oppressed by a ubiquitous and unfortunate _Weltanschauung_, the vast majority of people will not feel the need to resist. Living in a world in which certain ideas and attitudes are universal, they will not question them. Their bodies may not yet be racked by the all-consuming fevers of ideology, but they are at least comfortably secure in certain basic truths that they hold self-evident.

Thus are they host to the very unquestioning acceptance of conventional truth that the rationalistic atheists of our time decry. In our time, conventional truth has walked off the cliff, and plunged into the pit of insanity. As an antidote to this blind trust in convention and authority, proceeding at times to the point of dogmatism, I propose religion. Certainly the rationalistic atheists are in no positition to dismiss this proposition offhand, as the modern world is a world of their own making. As an acquaintance of a friend recently said, “They wanted a godless society, and they got it.”

The religious individual is less susceptible to social pressure in its direct and indirect forms. He will have the courage to resist it, and the vision to see beyond the narrow worldview pressed upon him by it. The religious individual is accustomed to seeing beyond things. He attempts to see beyond the world even; how then can he fail to see beyond prevailing social conditions? Religion broadens the mind, shaking it loose from the grasp of the petty fashions of the hour.

Religion, in its noblest form, requires the individual to ask the big questions. And to ask the big questions is to engage in the most strenuous process of intellectual inquiry. The heavens are vaster than the earth; and the man who fixes his eye on the heavens is less susceptible to the oppressive smog that chokes all truth and life from the earth.

I do not doubt that there are rationalistic atheists in existence, who continue to blame the blind faith of their fellow secularists on religion. The shoe, however, is on the other foot. It is unquestioning, dogmatic secularism that is today a threat to intellectual inquiry. It is religion that offers the individual the opportunity to open his mind and, by asking the biggest questions, gain some perspective on the littler ones.
