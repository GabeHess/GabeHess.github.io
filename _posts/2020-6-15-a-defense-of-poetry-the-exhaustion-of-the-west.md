title: "A Defense of Poetry: The Exhaustion of the West [ⅠⅠⅠ]"
description: "If meter is essential to poetry, the answer is in the question..."
---

If meter is essential to poetry, the answer is in the question. In other words, if meter is exhausted, poetry is exhausted. If poetry is exhausted, Western culture is exhausted. And if Western culture is exhausted, Christianity is exhausted. The world is a tired, haggard old thing, which has bit the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, and awoken a cynic. Culture has died in modern cynicism. We should remember that cynicism often accompanies age, and the cynicism of the West has come with the bitter old age of the West.

The cynicism of age, however, often turns into the quiet wisdom, or the patient resignation, of the “twilight years.” But this is not Eliot’s solution, nor, I think, the appropriate one. Patient resignation, and even quiet wisdom, occur in the face of death. For the West now to be quietly wise or patiently resigned is to admit that the Western idea is dead. It is to admit that Christianity is dead.

To admit that meter is dead is to admit that the forces of chaos have won over order and rationality, at least temporarily. (This question of whether Eliot represents a temporary descent into chaos, before the reemergence into order, which, however, has not yet occurred, I shall take up in the final chapter.)

If the forms that man has built up over two thousand years, as a screen between himself and the void, have come to exhaustion, then the forces of chaos have won, and Eliot’s solution is to fight modernity from within. He uses the very tools of cynicism and chaos to topple the edifice of modernity. But modernity is not an edifice at all—it is not constructive—it is destructive. And one cannot fight chaos with chaos, or cynicism with more cynicism.

Chesterton saw what was evil in the modern world but did not believe evil had won. C.S. Lewis pragmatically attempted to salvage what was good in modernity—and he attempted to build, and succeeded. But Eliot does not attempt to build. He does not transcend modernity, he sinks into it. Probably the history of culture in the West since the Renaissance is a history of the gradual exhaustion of culture, as our vision of transcendent order has broken down. And things came to a series of crises, like many things, throughout the twentieth century. Eliot represents the major crisis of poetry, and after Eliot we see nothing but a vista of convention that is staler than ever. We see a return to a lackluster vision, a Christian humanism with all the life sucked out of it. We see the reign of blandness and irrelevance in poetry, which shows little prospect of ending, though I believe it will, and perhaps soon. Contemporary poetry, where it is not nihilistic, is emptied of all moral, intellectual, and aesthetic content.

That contemporary poetry is a return to stale form signifies that there was no room for progress in the direction of Eliot. Contemporary poetry has no life in it. Why does contemporary poetry have no life in it? Because the direction of culture and poetry has been toward decay, that decay at some point had to cease, and when it ceased the cessation was artificial—mere wishful thinking.

There are several tactics thrown up before decay, to prevent its inevitable march. One of these is aesthetic dissent without any positive solution. It may be a cry for a simpler age, and a form of it is Romanticism. Romanticism is an attempt, not so much to salvage something from the ashes, as to disappear into a world of reveries and fancy and hold out for the return of the past.

Another temporary expedient used to obstruct the march of progress is satire.

  Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires,  
  The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.  

And when the meteor has expired, chaos comes to reign over the earth. If anything is salvaged from the reign of chaos, it is only a sense of something beyond chaos. But this something beyond chaos subsists in the mind of the ordered individual. And if the individual is ordered, there is hope for the world, but only through the ordered efforts of the individual.

Eliot is the product of a world in which wit has shot its momentary fires. His is the voice of chaos, albeit chaos still shot through with vestiges of order. And the world after Eliot is one in which dullness reigns, formal dullness, but all the duller for its formality. Thus Pope may have been backward in his allegory—or there may be a complex relation between dullness and chaos, in which both cooperate to the exclusion of order. Or the pendulum may swing from chaos to dullness and dullness to chaos, until the final triumph of chaos comes.

Eliot’s is a world in which satire and retreat have become impossible. And in this world, as it comes to us through his poetry, it is no longer possible to fight tooth and nail for a vision that is dead. It is a world in which one cannot go out with a bang, since there is not enough explosive energy left. It is a thoroughly tired and exhausted world, in which to hope for a rush of young, enthusiastic blood to sweep over society, refreshing it from its cynicism and rekindling the fires of Christianity, is mere fantasy.

I use the word “young” as a metaphor; but this solution is that we fight for a truth which we believe to be timeless and not subject to the historical process. The aesthete might crawl into a corner and expire with a whimper, the last bits of bluster everywhere going out with a bang, but those who believe in the literal truth of the Christian religion can only conclude that more joyous times await. This belief is not a hope for the reinvigoration of the West, it is the actual reinvigoration of the West. The West is exhausted because it has lost belief. The renewal of belief is itself a breathing of new life into Western culture and the Western vision.

The man of faith is not a holdout from a dying world; he is a new bud of life. He alone is able to overthrow modernity, and restore the vigor of our culture, returning to meter and form in poetry, rather than crawling on his belly through Eliot’s slimy world of cigarette ends and sandwich paper. The solution to modernity, in other words, is full-throated dissent—an alternative proclaimed with a booming voice. The solution is not to retreat into modernity’s very forms. The “bald spot in the middle of the hair” and the thin arms and legs are nothing—the hair will grow back and the arms and legs will gain muscle—but only if we offer a solution to modernity, and not modernity itself.

This is not to say that modernity must be rejected _in toto_. Surely this is impossible. But timeless truths expressed beautifully are not impossible in a modern context. Or if they are, no one can claim for Eliot the shred of a triumph over modernity.

The answer to the question whether meter and form are now impossible is this: the poets of the future will answer. Is Western civilization and by extension form exhausted? Let us see. If they are, we might retreat to within the memory of the past, or seek to comfort ourselves with the opiates of Eliot. But gone will be the optimism of the Christian era. Human life will return to its tragic condition. Eliot, the tragic poet, will be our sole representative in the modern age.

But historical fatalism operates on the premise that we believe in it. If we do not believe, we see that history is in our hands. And if history is in our hands, why do we not act accordingly? Why, the scientific community, represented by such men as Stephen Meyer, William Dembski, and Michael Behe, has done better than we have! They have offered a viable alternative to materialism. But we have offered no viable solution in the domain of culture.

Modernity is a dialogue between those who usher in the reign of emptiness, and those who paint portraits of the emptiness without offering any solution. This may be from an illusion of necessity, or a belief that the attack on modernity must come from within. The Christian revolution is dead, and henceforth any change of regime must be by subversion. We must let our principles leak like water into the foundations of the modern edifice. Only by capturing the machinery of the modern world, and exploiting its tools against it, will we triumph over it. One does not, however, transcend the puddle by staring morbidly into the puddle. Rather than spend our time

  …in one-night cheap hotels  
  And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells,  

let us build cathedrals to reside in. If we then find ourselves in the minority, that is perhaps to be expected. Otherwise, we would be in the majority, and could only wonder how we got there.
