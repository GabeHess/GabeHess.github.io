Here is the first stanza of W.B Yeats’ “The Second Coming”:

Turning and turning in the widening gyre  
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  
The best lack all conviction, while the worst  
Are full of passionate intensity.  

This stanza is a remarkable feat of poetic social analysis. It is probable that no other poet has expressed in so few lines so much about the malady of an age. Yet these eight lines are rational and articulate. As such, according to the modern school, they cannot convey the full complexity or indeterminacy of reality.

They were written in 1919. The first two lines are an image expressing much about the times. The falcon, turning in ever widening circles, has drifted so far from the falconer that it cannot hear him, and he has lost all control, just as man has lost control of the processes he has set in motion. The result, for man, is that things fall apart. Things fall apart because the center cannot hold. As a consequence, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. The forces of nihilism and destruction are loosed, and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned. “The ceremony of innocence” is a phrase which many would hesitate to put together. It couples ceremony, or a convention of at least partly civilized man, with innocence. Here is no arcadian dream. Here is the realistic view that there is some connection between ceremony and innocence—that innocence itself is a ceremony. Here is a rejection of liberation and the misguided ideal of absolute “freedom.” In the end, the cause of this chaos and destruction is that the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity. Probably the center must be convinced, otherwise it cannot hold. The myth of “moderation” as a cure for “extremism” is fallacy.

Let us take another poem. Though I almost feel it is a crime to quote the end of the fourth book of _The Dunciad_, by Alexander Pope, without at least quoting earlier parts of the fourth book, I shall do so, it being directly relevant to our purposes.

As the Empire of Dullness achieves dominion over the earth, lulling all into uniform sleep, the last giddy defenses are thrown up, then the reign of Chaos and Night, of whom Dullness is the seed, comes.

Fancy and wit die first. The arts wink out one by one. Like the last hurrah of a dying insect—or any creature flailing about in spasmodic ecstasy before its last breath—(the reader will forgive me: I too can indulge in morbidities on occasion)—Truth, Philosophy, Mathematics and the rest undergo their last paroxysms then die. Religion, morality, humanity, divinity—all expire; then Chaos comes.

In vain, in vain—the all-composing hour  
Resistless falls; the Muse obeys the power.  
She comes! she comes! the sable throne behold  
Of Night primeval, and of Chaos old!  
Before her Fancy’s gilded clouds decay,  
And all its varying rainbows die away.  
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires,  
The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.  
As one by one, at dread Medea’s strain,  
The sick’ning stars fade off th’ ethereal plain;  
As Argus’ eyes, by Hermes’ wand opprest,  
Closed one by one to everlasting rest;  
Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,  
Art after Art goes out, and all is night.  
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled,  
Mountains of casuistry heap’d o’er her head!  
Philosophy, that lean’d on Heaven before,  
Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.  
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence,  
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense!  
See Mystery to Mathematics fly!  
In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.  
Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires,  
And unawares Morality expires.  
Nor public flame, nor private, dares to shine;  
Nor human spark is left, nor glimpse divine!  
Lo! thy dread empire, Chaos! is restor’d;  
Light dies before thy uncreating word:  
Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall;  
And universal Darkness buries all.  

The poem, like Yeats’, is rational and articulate. Pope identifies conceptual players. He speaks in rational terms that may be apprehended and judged by the mind. And he pens a masterpiece—if, at times, a petulant masterpiece—of the English language.[^1] In the last words of the poem, he gives us something to shudder at. When we read Eliot, it is Eliot himself that we shudder at.

Dr. Johnson as well, in _The Vanity of Human Wishes_, assumes that the objects of his satire are articulable. But Eliot attempts to express the inexpressible. Others have assumed that the inexpressible is only inexpressible if the author’s intellectual capacities are wanting, if the object to be expressed does not exist, or if the object is God. Eliot assumes that inchoate or irrational man is more fundamental than rational man, as if man becomes more human by becoming less.

[^1]: As I was preparing to send this book to the press, and reading it over one more time, a jagged edge caught me, which was this sentence. Certainly there are parts, including the part quoted, of _The Dunciad_ which bespeak the highest flights of human genius. But to call the poem a “masterpiece” proves once again that one should beware using words wantonly, for it is all too easy to ascribe superlatives and  hyperbolic praise merely by virtue of not thinking. That _The Dunciad_ is superior to anything written these days is undoubtable, but that it is a masterpiece of Pope or the language is improbable.
