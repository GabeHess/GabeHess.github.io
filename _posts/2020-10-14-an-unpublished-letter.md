We often hear the line that democracy is under attack. In the vice presidential debate, Senator Kamala Harris warned against those who are trying to “subvert our democracy.” How a democracy can be subverted by the outcome of a democratic election beats me, especially when those apparently on the side of democracy also favor more government control, and those apparently against democracy favor individual liberty and limited government.

If our democracy is under attack, it is not the fault of the Trump Administration. From the moment President Trump received his democratic mandate to take office in January, 2017, he has met with desperate opposition. Millions signed petitions to sway electors to turn faithless and vote for Clinton. Millions more marched in protest around the country. Members of the “Resistance” pinned safety pins on their shirts. And we have all heard the sentiment, “He’s not my President.”

Democrats in Congress have resisted President Trump to the point of obsession. Their friends in the media have lied about him. Corporate America has funded opposition to him. Big tech has censored his supporters. Virtually every major institution in the country has been against him. And BLM and Antifa have driven the point home by rioting in cities such as Portland and Seattle, even as powerful Democrats have turned a blind eye.

Trump has been president for four long years, during which time America has become more prosperous, safer, stronger, and more just. He has battled a global virus, maintaining a balance between health and the need for a sound social and economic order, where others have spread fear and economic destruction. But not only have Democrats fought him every step of the way, they have done their best to fill this country with hatred and misery from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Trump supporters are afraid to say what they think. Everybody feels it: the Democrats are doubling down, and the pressure has mounted.

If the polls are to be trusted, it seems to be working. It is a testament to the efficacy of temper-tantrums. When those in power throw a violent enough temper-tantrum, they get their way. That will be the message if the Biden/Harris ticket, the single least impressive ticket in the history of American politics, manages to sleepwalk its way into the White House.

So, yes, democracy is under attack. It is not a democracy when the people crying “democracy” define “democracy” as them getting what they want, and they do get what they want. It is not a democracy when a populist president is finally ousted by an elite liberal class. That is why I hope my fellow ——— County residents will not let the pressure get to them, but will join me in casting my ballot for President Trump on November 3rd.
