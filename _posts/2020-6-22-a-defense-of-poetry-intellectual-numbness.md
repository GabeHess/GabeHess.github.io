Eliot does not attempt to express truth, while evoking sentiment that corresponds to it, within the confines of aesthetic splendor. He does not attempt to converse with the reader through the universal medium of reason. Just as sentiment is a reaction to an object, Eliot attempts to produce an intellectual reaction to the mist-enshrouded objects that leer through his poetry. He produces an effect on the reader. The reader does not have to grapple with his poetry. But if he does grapple, he is not grappling with his poetry, he is grappling with objects of historical interest or with himself. And he is not grappling with himself in a healthy introspective way, he is grappling with his own psychology—that monolithic adversary and stone against which modern man dashes himself to pieces. Or, to do Eliot justice, the reader might be grappling with Eliot’s theme—for even Eliot is not so far gone as not to have a theme. But too often the theme itself is incoherence—rendering the whole affair about as weighted against the reader as it can be.

Eliot’s poetry borrows not from emotional sense but intellectual sense. It undermines the very foundations of a meaningful life. The Romantics assaulted the nerves; Eliot assaults the neurons. The Romantics could give expression to and excite moments of strong feeling. Eliot numbs all feeling, and forces the brain into certain morbid grooves. He demands absolute surrender. He is not a dualist: he does not permit that the head and heart coexist. Romantic poetry could be understood by head and heart alike; Eliot’s poetry produces nothing but feelings.

Rousseau could be one moment a swooning Romantic, the next a rational Frenchman. If we are to judge by his poetry, Eliot was at all times the evocative genius. He did not leave any avenue of escape.

Seemingly Eliot’s purpose, in many places, was to impress upon the reader the full weight of the emptiness of the modern world. At any rate, his poetry does exactly that. He evokes a feeling of emptiness in the reader. And if that emptiness is intended not as a targeted criticism of the times, but as a modern expression of timeless truth, we must conclude that timeless truth is empty.

To evoke an intellectual feeling of emptiness is an extraordinary feat—paradoxical on two levels. It is to evoke an _intellectual feeling_—which, of course, is difficult to argue with in soberer moments. And it is to have that _feeling_ be of _emptiness_—a lack. Thus, on the most fundamental level, there is nothing to his poems. They evoke feelings, and those feelings may be analyzed without being understood, but that is all. And where Eliot evokes other feelings, they are by his own testimony inscrutable to reason.

Keats writes,

…a drowsy numbness pains  
&nbsp; &nbsp; My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,  
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains  
&nbsp; &nbsp; One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:  

That is about how one feels reading Eliot.

I suppose it should be possible to evoke any number of inarticulable feelings, but the effect when Eliot does it is to produce a sort of intellectual numbness. His poetry produces the familiar heat in the skull that generally comes of shame and consciousness of ignominy. One feels emptied and sick to one’s stomach. Thus the question, if we are to determine Eliot’s place as a poet, is to determine how fundamental to man are the feelings of emptiness and sickness to one’s stomach.

It is certainly rather easy to feel empty and sick to one’s stomach. It is accomplished in times of illness with remarkable frequency. But illness is not the ordinary condition of man, nor in our illness do we seek to magnify the effects that we might feel as sick as we can. The usual conduct for the sick man is to seek health—only the nihilist is self-destructive.

So, while the poet minted by his times might give expression to nihilism and decay, the Christian poet will reach out his hand for vitality and health. If he warns of the destructive impulse of the times, he will do so in rational language, paying his readers the supreme compliment of assuming they are rational beings, able to understand articulate speech. He will not allow himself to be a mirror for chaos, reflecting the tendencies of the times indiscriminately. He will seek for order even in the void—assuming, of course, that he believes it can and will be found.

I believe there are many Christians who do not understand modernity. They do not understand, on the one hand, that modernity runs counter to everything they believe is true, and constitutes a singular threat, which must be rebelled against and overcome. And they do not understand, on the other hand, that modernity will not simply be overcome: the rebellion will swell up from within modernity itself. Christians are in the difficult situation of having to rebel against modernity with intense energy by specifically targeting the errors of modernity, while using the indomitable elements of modernity as a weapon. They cannot ignore science; they must prove science wrong, using the methods of science, or show rigorously, with attention to details, why it is not incompatible with Christianity. They cannot return to a pre-technological age; they must work within a technological age to restore their vision to the world. They cannot coexist with bad science or with certain effects of technology on man. They cannot coexist with Eliot. Or if they can, it is only by being always on the defensive, and stripping their religion of everything but bare metaphysics. The Christian worldview has certain implications for the world, which stand in direct opposition to Eliot’s poetry.

Politically all the momentum is against them. Therefore, their primary political concern is to secure freedom. They must then work within that freedom to persuade the individual that unrestrained freedom of the will is not freedom at all.

But they must not be afraid to fight for the individual in the strongest and most accurate language. And on the cultural front, they must resist liberation with the inspiration that comes of genius. To use the language of decay is to admit they have lost. But they must not admit they have lost. They must fight, and in proportion to the vigor with which they fight, the sails of their vision will expand, and they will, in fact, emerge victorious. If they give expression to decay, they should do so in language that by its very nature points to something beyond it.

Christians must realize that their best friend is reason—it is all they have in their arsenal. They must not be tricked by the pseudo-scientific chauvinists into thinking that they must fight or ignore science and reason. They must assert time and again that they have reason and the evidence on their side. And they must not be tricked by the modern school of poetry into thinking that they have so thoroughly lost that they can only gesture wordlessly in the direction of Shantih—a word expressed in a foreign language.
