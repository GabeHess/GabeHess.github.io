It is obvious to anyone observing our society from a traditional or Christian perspective, that we live in a decadent society. (When I refer to the “decadent society,” that is not a reference to the book of that title, which I have not read).

There are several aspects of decadence in our society which I intend to outline here. First there is materialism. The moment a society has abandoned all sense or concept of virtue, all transcendent or, to be more precise, religious ideals, and decided to devote itself purely to the pursuit of material goods, that society has become decadent. This is a description of our own society.

Of course our society is not uniformly or entirely decadent. It is certain that no society in human history has been entirely decadent, and, in addition, every society has had some element of decadence. Our own society entertains a very significant revolutionary strain. This is not unusual. Decadence and revolution—and more broadly speaking, decadence and civil tumult—walk hand in hand. Pre-revolutionary France was in many ways a decadent society.

A materialistic society is also, by necessity, superficial. It does not worry about the meaning of life. It does not ask the big questions. It probably is not even aware that there are big questions to ask. In our own society, men such as the New Atheists (specifically the Four Horsemen of the New Atheism, who were not, in fact, horsemen, but rather intellectual pygmies on pony-back), who until recently were able to maintain a place in intellectual discourse, and whose ideas are even now not discredited among their old audience, or among the thinking classes, are not laughed off the stage whenever they take it upon themselves to address an audience. This is indicative of superficiality such as might make one reel.

The New Atheists told our society that there are no big questions to ask, and that the asking of them can be treated as a spell to be broken, or even a form of mental illness. That is superficial. But people received them with sympathy, and even those inclined to vituperate them did not always do so while peering more closely into the fundamentals of existence.

Such a decadent society is also immoral. It has lost sight of all basic ethical norms. Obviously this describes our own society. Witness the divorce rate; witness the universities; witness the behavior of our children, and the complacency of our children’s parents; witness the _Super Bowl Halftime Show_; witness social media. Across our society there are signs of our having abandoned standards completely—from billboards, to online advertising, to popular culture. Not only do we ignore morality (which is a more controversial word than ethics, as the latter can be taken in the sense of professional or social ethics), we have forgotten that it exists. Mention morality—or, for goodness’ sake, _virtue_—in polite society, and you will be either laughed at or violently attacked. You will be seen as a reactionary, crackpot, or, probably, religious fanatic eager to impose your own exploded moralism on members of the rainbow. Probably few societies have been as disconnected from basic moral reality as our modern archipelago of secular, once-Christian societies.

Obviously if we do not admit the validity of basic morals, we shall hardly be a moral society.

Our society is also irreligious. Indeed, in all senses of the term: not only are we often indifferent to religion, many times we are actively hostile toward it.

A decadent society is—as is our own—complacent in the face of threats, be they external or internal. The barbarians are at the gates, and the decadent society hardly twitches a finger. True, it might rally itself from its stupor for long enough to make a last desperate attempt to repulse the barbarians, but by then it is too late.

The decadent society, it follows from all we have said, is disconnected from reality—basic reality: ethical, historical, economic, physical and (apparently) biological. It hardly believes in nature, let alone the supernatural. In our own time, witness transgenderism. In transgenderism there remains a certain acknowledgement of reality. You cannot believe you ought to have been a man if you are a woman and “there is no gender.” But transgenderism sometimes branches out into the idea that “there is no gender,” “gender is a spectrum” (“everything is a spectrum”), “there are an infinite number of genders,” “gender is as personal as name,” &c., &c. Obviously the majority of American do not believe this stuff, but the fact that these ideas are acceptable in our society, and promulgated and supported at times by our institutions, renders them legitimate measure of the surreality we are living in. Or I need not mention the recent earnest support of many for “defunding the police.”

There are a number of more mundane ways in which a society becomes disconnected from reality. In particular, the decadent society is disconnected from the realities of human nature and original sin. Perhaps in our society, the only reality forced upon us, is the very hard reality of “the enemy.”

At this point we have a picture of a society that has lost all sense of purpose, has become disconnected from reality, and is merely drifting along. Probably it is rocked by civil tumult, since such is one consequence of the loss of meaning. Obviously it is drifting toward its own devastation.

In such a society, the institutions have ceased to serve their purpose. Bureaucracies grow and flourish. Bureaucracies are infamous for betraying the purpose they were intended to serve, and devoting themselves to perpetuating their existence, and feeding themselves on the still vital marrow of the surrounding society. Needless to say, the state takes on new proportions. Since my purpose here is descriptive, I am not concerned with the causal relationship between the growth of state power and the increasing decadence of society.

As institutions lose connection with their original purpose, they become corrupt. By definition they are corrupt. They serve themselves, when they were intended to serve others—that is the essence of corruption.

The political class in a decadent society is inevitably composed of weak, vain men, whose only interest is to perpetuate their own position and power—men whose sole concern is being reelected—cowardly, afraid men with no real convictions of their own. These too are corrupt.

The institutions are drifting. The last thing they want is for someone to rock the boat, for someone to call them back to their purpose, to hold them accountable—to threaten their existence. Such an individual would be at once a shaker up of things and a prophet calling society back to the golden age of virtue.

An interesting question would be where President Trump fits into this picture. Obviously Trump, in 2016, was the outsider—the anti-establishment, anti-corruption candidate; he is also now the defender of American traditions, of the American system, of America.

At the same time, he might be seen as the culminating symptom and product of decadence. His tweets, his rhetoric, his crudity, his character, &c. militate against him in that respect.

These are the two sides of the picture. In the next essay, I purpose to examine President Trump’s role in the decadent society.
